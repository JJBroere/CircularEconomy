\section{Model Description}

\textit{The mathematical description given here is assumed to be necessary and sufficient for any implementation of the model. [need to clarify possible implementation bias]}


Let agents are $N$ companies indexed by $1\leq i\leq N$, that have a fixed spatial position $\vec{x}_i$. By-products are assumed to be described by a finite-dimensional random variable $\vec{y}\in \mathbb{R}^d$. Finite values are a reasonable domain for by-products characteristics as it allows to normalize along each axis and take $\vec{y} \in \left[0,1\right]^d$. Each company has a demand function and an offer function, which were used to establish links between pairs of companies (i.e. exchange of by-products). These function are defined in a simple manner by $\vec{D}_i (\vec{y})= D_i^{(0)}\cdot \vec{d}_i (\vec{y})$ and $\vec{O}_i (\vec{y})= O_i^{(0)}\cdot \vec{o}_i (\vec{y})$, where $\vec{d}_i$ and $\vec{o}_i$ are multivariate probability densities.
