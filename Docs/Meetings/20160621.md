# Meeting : converging

## Reports on Literature Review

 * Mario : clues to look into historical literature. Old societies that were fucked up because of economical ecosystem collapse. (Evelyn) : beware of not oversimplyfying. "Airship hippies" in Taos -> sustainability (DIY)
 * Ben :
    - (Olsen, 1982) : space-time scales for evolution of city metabolism. -> useful for justifying multi-scale. 
    - Kennedy paper : Q of dataset : not that much dataset. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics. introduce game-theory
 * Lorraine : urban metabolism. Cities as ecosystems. paper : Hardy. foodweb analysis of industrial ecoparks
 
**important question : type of agents, classification ? -> better from the ecology point of view**

**rq Ben : normative vs study ? -> Christine : maybe for any system it is not that pertinent . what is a waste ?**

**also we need to converge on the static/dynamic question** 

**model complexity**

 * Christine : ecopark in China. Trophic structure. What's in what's out.
 * Marius : foodweb. ABM : best way. **Q: what scale ? primary, secondary etc consumers, decomposers** Categories for the circular economy ?
 
External resources -> [System] -- System : Primary producers -> consumers <-> resellers -> secondary producers -> tertiary producers
-> communities at different levels. **not necessary local**

 * Evelyn : global (<-> global ressources). foodwebs. complementarity networks. how to grow a model based on complementarity. -> network growth. <-> link with Joris game-theoretical idea. Growing network. -> path-dependance in the final network.
 Life cycle analysis : data for fisheries. Balance natural ressources flows. (Lorraine : flow model with 
 * Joris : game-theoretic model : company gloves. sell by pairs but produce even number. common utility of remaining supplies. generative rule for the growing network.
 Multi-scale model : successive boundaries.

 -- writing the model on blackboard -- Q : stationarity ? Dynamical ? # parameters ? - multi-scale ? qualitative difference between levels. -> macro level allows to have consistent urban system (scaling etc).
