## Reports on Literature Review

 * Mario : clues to look into historical literature. Old societies that were fucked up because of economical ecosystem collapse. (Evelyn) : beware of not oversimplyfying. "Airship hippies" in Taos -> sustainability (DIY)
 * Ben :
    - (Olsen, 1982) : space-time scales for evolution of city metabolism. -> useful for justifying multi-scale. 
    - Kennedy paper : Q of dataset : not that much dataset. Nonequilibrium thermodynamics. introduce game-theory
 * Lorraine : urban metabolism. Cities as ecosystems. paper : Hardy. foodweb analysis of industrial ecoparks
 ** important question : type of agents, classification ? -> better from the ecology point of view **
 ** rq Ben : normative vs study ? -> Christine : maybe for any system it is not that pertinent . what is a waste ? **
 ** also we need to converge on the ststaic/dynamic question **
