# SFI Meeting - 17/06/2016

## Summary / ideas

Q : optimal size/scale
Analogy to ecosystem : relatively closed system, as an island ?
-> Urban metabolism.

conditions and sensitivity to parameters ?
sensitivity to shrink/growth (add node) ; resilience of the network of flows ?
diagram on energy flows etc.

optimizing on a single objective/multi-objective ?

Abstract question : implies zero growth. which growth ? 
Jim Jackson : book [prosperity without growth].

be careful not to be political ! (cf Abigail)

is it possible/feasible ? -> implies quantitatively resilience etc.
(ex. too much specialized systems : more sensitive to disruption. applies to ecosystem, innovation)

Concept of ecological niche. how does recycle such materials, type of flows, many species compete.
