# SFI Meeting - 17/06/2016

## Summary / ideas

Q : optimal size/scale
Analogy to ecosystem : relatively closed system, as an island ?
-> Urban metabolism.

conditions and sensitivity to parameters ?
sensitivity to shrink/growth (add node) ; resilience of the network of flows ?
diagram on energy flows etc.

optimizing on a single objective/multi-objective ?

Abstract question : implies zero growth. which growth ? 
Jim Jackson : book [prosperity without growth].

be careful not to be political ! (cf Abigail)

is it possible/feasible ? -> implies quantitatively resilience etc.
(ex. too much specialized systems : more sensitive to disruption. applies to ecosystem, innovation)

Concept of ecological niche. how does recycle such materials, type of flows, many species compete.
-> network of interactions ?

modeling techniques ? ! influence Q/paradigms. [Q : nw modelers : Mika ?]
(what about model of reorganizing systems).
interconnectedness of the network ? definitively network properties.

Growth model : network growth model. !! choice between static/dynamic. ¡¡
open/close system ?
Human naturally tend to put boundaries.

Modeling as a foodweb -- linked to niche (more precise on habitat, environmental conditions etc)

Cities : policy / spatial embedding.

context of global human settlements. -> focus on single scale.

coupling scales : local foodweb, optimized. embedd into urban system : macro-scale. if only the bottom-up feedback, not top-down, should be simple coupling. mean-field approximation.
scale the local foodweb with scaling laws.

Q : is it capitalism ? what utility function ? economic component. costful for the transition, but less after that.

quantity of top-down control : governance. (local communes ?)
-> if this question is answered at the local level, then embedding into urban system should yield feasibility.

How do you spend your money/energy ?

Remainder : social system : top-down control -- the importance of governance

humanities approach : history, etc. feasibility.

## Choices 

* Network (ecological model) : OK . BUT include givernance principles, "top-down control" 
* Choice : network growth model / static model ?
* Choice : one_two scales

## Research Questions

* Feasibility, depending on parameters such as governance level. consequence on reseilence etc.
* Embeddability into existing urban systems -> multi-scale modeling.


## Methods

to be precised

## Organization

### Todo list

* Literature review
  - ecological foodweb : Marius, Chrsitina, Evelyn
  - scale/management : Evelyn
  - city metabolism / cities as ecosystems : Lorraine, Ben
  - History etc. : Jesus
  - Network Growth/ Urban econmy : Juste, Joris
  - industrial symbiosis : Joris

* Begin models
  -> next brainstorming

## Deadlines

 * Tuesday 21/06 : first pass on litearture review
 * Wednesday 22/06 : first draft for proposal

## Next meetings

 * Tuesday 21/06 : 7pm : think on models etc.
 * Wednesday 22/06 : 5pm15 with Josh
